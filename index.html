          A college (Latin: collegium) is an educational institution or a constituent part of one. A college may be a degree-awarding
          tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university, an institution offering vocational education, or a
          secondary school.<br> In most of the world, a college may be a high school or secondary school, a college of further education, a
          training institution that awards trade qualifications, a higher-education provider that does not have university status (often
          without its own degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university.

          Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In
          pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from
          one generation to the next.<br> As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through
          imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom. Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu
          Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607 Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first
          institution of higher learning in Europe.

          Instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called
          teachers, and they direct the education of students and might draw on many subjects like reading, writing, mathematics, science
          and history.Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called teachers, instructors, or professors, depending on the
          type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline.<br>Studies[which?]from the BD suggest that the quality
          of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on
          international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible.
